excerpt: Copepods are abundant, widely distributed, and incredibly diverse. However, we still don't know how much thermal limits vary between species, orders, or habitats. This limits our ability to predict how aquatic communities may be affected by climate change.

title: Diversity of Copepod Thermal Limits

### New methods for new data  
Copepods are some of the most abundant animals on the planet and play important roles in aquatic systems. They are also an extremely diverse group, with morphologies, physiologies, and ecologies adapted to the full range of aquatic habitats. However, we lack thermal limit data for much of this diversity, limiting our ability to predict how copepods (and therefore aquatic communities in general) may be affected by climate change. Focusing on the copepods found in Connecticut (USA), this project aims to increase the coverage of thermal limit measurements across taxonomic orders (Calanoida, Cyclopoida, Harpacticoida, etc.) and habitats (marine and freshwater). In order to accomplish this, I have developed a low-cost, highly portable set-up to reliably measure thermal limits for copepods (and other small ectotherms).
