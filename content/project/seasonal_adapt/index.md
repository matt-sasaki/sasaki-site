### For all things there is a season
Organisms in temperate environments often experience a large seasonal range of temperatures. Copepod populations in Long Island Sound, for example, experience an annual temperature range of over 20 degrees. Because of their short life cycles, this variation is experienced across rather than within generations. This sets up several interesting questions regarding 1) the roles of phenotypic plasticity and genetic differentiation (via balanced polymorphism) in helping populations persist in seasonal environments, and 2) the similarities between spatial and seasonal patterns in thermal adaptation. Past work combined insights from field experiments and laboratory common garden experiments to document patterns of thermal tolerance in the field throughout the year, and identified genetic variation in both thermal tolerance and tolerance plasticity in copepods collected at different times of year. Interestingly, similar patterns emerged from summer to winter as we had previously observed across the latitudinal thermal gradient, from low- to high-latitude populations.
