excerpt: Temperature has near universal effects on biological functions, and can affect ecological interactions like predation. Long-term changes in temperature may also drive evolutionary adaptation, modifying these ecological effects of temperature. Predicting ecological interactions under climate change scenarios requires that these evolutionary effects be taken into account.

### Selective Feeding   
Our ability to predict organismal responses to climate change is limited not only by an incomplete understanding of how warming affects ecological interactions and evolutionary dynamics individually, but also by the unknown capacity for the two to interact. One such potential interaction is the effect thermal adaptation will have on selective feeding, a common trait in marine copepods. Increasing temperatures may drive a large-scale shift in the diet of omnivorous copepods towards stronger herbivory (due to fundamental differences in the temperature sensitivities of various metabolic processes). Changes in the trophic position of copepods would have significant consequences for the structure of marine food webs. However, adaptation to temperature may moderate or even nullify these shifts. Taking advantage of previously documented adaptation over several different spatial and temporal scales, we are currently studying not only how temperature affects selective feeding in a widespread marine copepod, but also how adaptation to increased temperature modifies this relationship.
