### Thermal Macrophysiology of Invertebrates
Widespread marine invertebrates often have distributions encompassing a large ranges of environmental conditions. Paired with their (usually assumed) large potential for gene flow, these species can be interesting model systems to study the balance between selection and gene flow. My work with the copepod Acartia tonsa studies how thermal tolerance and thermal tolerance plasticity vary across the Northwest Atlantic. Using common garden experiments with populations collected at sites ranging from Florida to Canada, we were able to disentangle the effects of genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity on thermal tolerance, as well as how tolerance plasticity itself varies across populations.
