  I am a marine biologist and evolutionary ecologist studying how marine organisms adapt to temperature over various spatial and temporal scales. I'm currently a post-doc at the University of Connecticut, working with Dr. Hans Dam on a project examining the interactions between thermal adaptation and the trophic ecology of omnivorous copepods. My dissertation work focused on how genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity contribute to spatial and seasonal patterns in thermal adaptation in marine copepods.
