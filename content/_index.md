description: I'm currently a postdoctoral associate at the University of Connecticut. 
  My research examines how aquatic organisms are affected by temperature, and how they adapt to cope with spatial and temporal variation in the thermal environment. My current project examines the interactions between thermal adaptation and the trophic ecology of omnivorous copepods. My dissertation work focused on how genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity contribute to spatial and seasonal patterns in thermal adaptation in marine copepods.
